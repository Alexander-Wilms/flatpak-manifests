	<description>
		<p>The Secret Chronicles of Dr. M. (TSC) is a two-dimensional sidecrolling platform game based on OpenGL and SDL. The game features a rich set of levels plus an advanced level editor that allows you to create your own levels. It is accompanied by a powerful scripting engine that utilises mruby, a minimal implementation of the Ruby programming language.</p>
<p>TSC is a fork of the SMC project, whose development has stalled. Note however that our goals are different from those of the original SMC project, most notably we are working towards our own type of game rather than being solely inspired by one specific existing game.</p>
